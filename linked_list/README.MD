# Linked List Implementation

This mini project is a linked list implementation in Rust. The main purpose of this mini project is to further improve my understanding in the ownership rules and borrowing in Rust, whilst improving my knowledge on several other features available in Rust.

## TODO

1. Use Option<LinkNode> for the list head
2. Implement Drop trait for when LinkNode is dropped
3. Implement Iterator for LinkNode
